    Description: For an exchange, get all trading pairs, their latest prices and trading volume for 24 hours
    Task:
        Create a class inherited from the BaseExchange class.
        Write the implementation of the methods and fill in the required fields (marked as "todo")
    Note:
        Feel free to add another internal methods.
        It is important that the example from the main function runs without errors
    The flow looks like this:
        1. Request data from the exchange
        2. We bring the ticker to the general format
        3. We extract from the ticker properties the last price,
            the 24-hour trading volume of the base currency
            and the 24-hour trading volume of the quoted currency.
            (at least one of the volumes is required)
        4. Return the structure in the format:
            {
                "BTC/USDT": TickerInfo(last=57000, baseVolume=11328, quoteVolume=3456789),
                "ETH/BTC": TickerInfo(last=4026, baseVolume=4567, quoteVolume=0)
